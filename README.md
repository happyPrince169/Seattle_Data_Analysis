Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:

    Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
    Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
    Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

# Description


I will use Seattle Airbnb dataset to answer these questions:

1. **How was the pricing change by time in 2016?**
2. **Top 5 neighborhoods which were the most expensive and the most affordable in Seattle?**
3. **How did the number of new hosts increase by time?**

# Libraries used

numpy==1.23.5
pandas==1.5.2
seaborn==0.12.1
matplotlib==3.6.2

This code runs with Python version 3.* and requires some libraries above, to install these libraries, you will need to execute:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Conclusion:

Based on what I have found from the datasets, I can say that summer in Seattle is the busy time and it would cost more compared to other seasons. If I want to save money when I stay in the state, I can consider to rent a homestay in the top neighborhoods which have the lowest average price, otherwise in the top most expensive, it could give me more worthy values. Finally, business of Airbnb has been growing, itâ€™s providing a solution for people to not waste their spare home.
