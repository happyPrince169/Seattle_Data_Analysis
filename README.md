# Seattle_Data_Analysis

The first analysis project of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.
Content

The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:

    Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
    Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
    Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

Inspiration

    Can you describe the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?
    What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
    Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle?

For more ideas, visualizations of all Seattle datasets can be found here.

# Description


I will use Seattle Airbnb dataset to answer these questions:

1. **How was the pricing change by time in 2016?**
2. **Top 5 neighborhoods which were the most expensive and the most affordable in Seattle?**
3. **How did the number of new hosts increase by time?**

Conclusion:

Based on what I have found from the datasets, I can say that summer in Seattle is the busy time and it would cost more compared to other seasons. If I want to save money when I stay in the state, I can consider to rent a homestay in the top neighborhoods which have the lowest average price, otherwise in the top most expensive, it could give me more worthy values. Finally, business of Airbnb has been growing, itâ€™s providing a solution for people to not waste their spare home.
